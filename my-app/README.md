### Hedera Stone ### 

Our project has one clear aim; to onboard, to Hedera, just some of the 200 million people who regularly spend their leisure hours researching their family tree. (Actually, we want ALL of them).

How will we do this? In three dimensions. NOBODY else is doing this. 

Added to the army of active genealogy researchers worldwide, is the generation that’s been used to gaming their teenage nights in the Metaverse where virtual 3D is their natural environment. A potential whole new generation of untapped HederaStone users, to whom micro payments in crypto is natural.

Wouldn’t everyone rather have a fully immerse virtual journey through their origins, and share that experience with others, rather than simply a framed heraldic print of their family tree on the wall? 

We think we know the answer to that!

At the core of this journey lies the capture and dissemination of millions of images. Capture To Earn (CTE) is the principle by which HBARbarians collect and submit images to HederaStone, from their local cemetery, in exchange for front-end HBAR, plus an eternal royalty share. The latter has the potential to become significant when considering that one person, only two or three generations back, could appear in many hundreds of family trees.

Very few cemeteries are well documented. Many records have been lost to war, flood, fire and neglect. Only the headstones are strong enough to have remained. Our mission is to forever preserve those headstones (or other physical memorials) on the Hashgraph, for the benefit of generations to come.

Along the way, the potential for HBAR wallet adoption, in order to pay for, and take custody of, 3D NFTs is eye-watering. To give just a sense of the scale; our local cemetery includes 51,000 graves dating back to 1855. 2D images have already been requested for over 50% of those graves. 

Every fresh wallet holder becomes an HBAR user for life.

We anticipate that adoption will be progressive in this way…
1.	Purchase of a single 2D image of the headstone of an ancestor, in the form of an NFT (with all the benefits of provenance that we know that brings).
2.	Purchase of a single 3D image of the gravesite, to be demonstrated to, and shared with, their older family members on a phone.
3.	Projection of that 3D image in AR. (Imagine the delight of grandma being able to “visit” and walk around the overseas grave of her brother, which she has never been able to visit in real life)
4.	Import of that 3D image into a metaverse environment, thus enhancing grandma’s delight and being able to simultaneously share the experience with overseas cousins.
5.	Expansion of the concept by purchasing more 3D NFT images in order to build a fully immersive walk-through family tree.
6.	Viral adoption by other researchers along other branches of the family.

HederaStone is predicated upon 2D and 3D imagery of headstones, minted as an NFT, and paid for in HBAR transactions (often via credit card). Hello Future!

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
